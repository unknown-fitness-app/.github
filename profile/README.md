# Unknown Wardrobe App

Welcome to the unknwon wardrobe app GitHub organization. This organization houses the design, documentation, and source code of an unknown wardrobe app that is being developed by a couple of friends. We have recently completeing our computer science educations and are looking to obtain real-word experience before entering the workforce. 

## About the app

### Features

This app aims to help users track the contents of their wardrobe/closet and state of clothing items. Some preliminary features include

- Clothing item specification
  - Tops
  - Bottoms
  - Undergarments
  - Socks and shoes
  - Accessories    
- Clothing item state
  - Date added (to wardrobe/closet)
  - Date last worn
  - Clean/soiled 
- Outfit specification
- Outfit generation

The finer details of these features have yet to be refined. Any additional features have not yet been discussed

### Application type

We are building a webapp that is capable of being self-hosted. The application will involve a frontend webview and a backend API and database to save application state. For the frontend webiew, we are considering using [VueJs](https://vuejs.org). The backend will likely be a Python web service.
