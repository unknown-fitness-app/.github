# Wardrobe app

Welcome to the unknwon fitness app GitHub organization. This organization houses the design, documentation, and source code of an unknown fitness app that is being developed by a couple of friends. We have recently completeing our computer science educations and are looking to obtain real-word experience before entering the workforce. 

## About the app

### Features

This app aims to help users track their workouts and see the progress overtime. Some preliminary features include

- Workout specification
- Intelligent workout adjustment (to prevent stagnation)
- Workout statistics and performance overviews

The finer details of these features have yet to be refined. Any additional features have not yet been discussed

### Application type

We are building a webapp that is capable of being self-hosted. The application will involve a frontend webview and a backend API and database to save application state. For the frontend webiew, we are considering using [VueJs](https://vuejs.org). The backend details have not yet been discussed.
